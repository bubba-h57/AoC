## About Advent of Code
Advent of Code is an [Advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar) of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in [any](https://github.com/search?q=advent+of+code) programming language you like. People use them as [interview prep](https://y3l2n.com/2018/05/09/interview-prep-advent-of-code/), [company training](https://twitter.com/pgoultiaev/status/950805811583963137), [university coursework](https://gribblelab.org/teaching/scicomp2021/index.html), [practice problems](https://comp215.blogs.rice.edu/), [a speed contest](https://adventofcode.com/leaderboard), or to [challenge each other](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/search?q=flair%3Aupping&restrict_sr=on).

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some [problem-solving skills](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/7kd8jt/what_would_you_say_are_the_minimal_skills_for/dre0uu3/) will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

## Solutions
These are my solutions. I try to do at least a few each year. One year, I might do the entirety of Advent, who knows?
